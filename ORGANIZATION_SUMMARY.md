## 🚀 How to Deploy Each Page

```
Deploy to: yourdomain.com/
File: maintenance/index.html
Time: When your site needs maintenance
```

### Option 2: Use Coming Soon Page
```
Deploy to: yourdomain.com/
File: coming_soon/index.html
Time: Before official launch
Transition: Redirect to main site when ready
```

### Option 3: Use Both Sequentially
```
Timeline:
1. Launch coming_soon/ on Day 1 (start buzz)
2. Keep it running for 30 days (countdown active)
3. On launch date:
   - Show maintenance/ page (final preparations)
   - After maintenance, deploy production site
```

## 🎨 Customization Quick Reference

### Update Launch Date (coming_soon/script.js):
```javascript
// Line ~20-21
const launchDate = new Date();
launchDate.setDate(launchDate.getDate() + 30); // Change 30 to your days
```

### Update Contact Info (both pages):
- **Maintenance page:** `maintenance/index.html` (search for email/phone)

:root {
    --primary-color: #6366f1;      /* Main brand color */
